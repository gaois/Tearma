# The téarma.ie project

This is the national terminology database for Irish, managed by the [Gaois](https://www.gaois.ie/) research group in [Fiontar & Scoil na Gaeilge](https://www.dcu.ie/fiontarscoilnagaeilge) (DCU) in partnership with the [Terminology Committee](https://www.forasnagaeilge.ie/fuinn/focloireacht/), [Foras na Gaeilge](https://www.forasnagaeilge.ie/).

Around 186,000 bilingual entries are available in the database. They can be queried in various ways, and the material can also be [downloaded](/ioslodail/) in TBX or TXT format. Information on using the website is available [here](/cabhair/conas-usaid.en). If you don’t find the term you are looking for, you can use the [query form](/ceist/) to ask the Terminology Committee, Foras na Gaeilge, for advice.

The project has been running since 2004. Phase VII is currently underway. A **new website and editorial system** were launched on 14 March 2019. The system is based on **Terminologue**, an open-source platform developed by Gaois for the National Terminology Database and as a resource for other projects. You can find out more about Terminologue [here](http://www.terminologue.org/).

Publications about terminology by Gaois can be found [here](https://www.gaois.ie/en/about/publications/). If you wish to keep up with terminology and other new developments, you can sign up for the [Gaois newsletter](https://www.gaois.ie/en/newsletter/) (in Irish), read the [Gaois blog](https://www.gaois.ie/en/blog/) (in Irish), or get the Term of the Day on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tearma_ie), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tearma_ie/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tearma.ie/). The story of the project is told [here](https://www.tearma.ie/eolas/stair.en).
