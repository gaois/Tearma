# The téarma.ie project

This is the national terminology database for Irish, managed by the [Gaois](https://www.gaois.ie/) research group in [Fiontar & Scoil na Gaeilge](https://www.dcu.ie/fiontar_scoilnagaeilge/gaeilge/index.shtml) (DCU) in partnership with the [Terminology Committee](https://www.forasnagaeilge.ie/fuinn/focloireacht/), [Foras na Gaeilge](https://www.gaeilge.ie/).

Around 185,000 bilingual entries are available in the database. They can be queried in various ways, and the material can also be [downloaded](http://www-tearma-ie.gaois.ie/download/) in TBX or TXT format. The database is linked with the [New Corpus for Ireland](/eolas/corpus.en). Information on using the website is available [here](/cabhair/conas-usaid.en). If you don’t find the term you are looking for, you can ask the Terminology Committee, Foras na Gaeilge, for advice using the [query form](/ceist/).

Phase VI of the project (running since 2005) is currently underway and as part of that phase, a **new site and editorial system** were launched on 13 March 2019. The system is based on **Terminologue**, an open-source platform developed by Fiontar & Scoil na Gaeilge for the National Terminology Database and as a resource for other projects. You can find out more about Terminologue [here](http://www.terminologue.org/).

Publications about terminology by Fiontar & Scoil na Gaeilge can be found [here](https://www.gaois.ie/eolas/en/publications/). If you wish to keep up with terminology and other new developments, you can sign up for the [Gaois newsletter](https://www.gaois.ie/email/en/) (in Irish), read the [Gaois blog](https://www.gaois.ie/blg/ga/) (in Irish), or get the Term of the Day on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tearma_ie), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tearma_ie/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tearma.ie/). The story of the project is told [here](/eolas/history.en).
