# I didn’t find what I was looking for

Remember that this is a terminology database containing specialised technical terms. You will not usually find general words here, nor translations of complete phrases or sentences. If you are looking for a general word you could try searching the online dictionaries at [foclóir.ie](https://www.focloir.ie/en/) or [teanglann.ie](https://www.teanglann.ie/en/). If you are looking for a placename, then you could try [logainm.ie](https://www.logainm.ie/en/), the National Placenames Database.

Try other spellings or wordings. Read through the [help files](/cabhair/conas-usaid.en) to understand how the search engine works.

If you believe the term you are looking for should be available here, you can [send a request to the Terminology Committee](/ceist/).
