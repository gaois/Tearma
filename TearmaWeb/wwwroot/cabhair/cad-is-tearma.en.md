# What is a term?

A term is a word, or a group of words, used to describe a concept. Here, we mean concepts in specific areas of knowledge, for example concepts in mathematics, in technology, in sports, in astronomy, in education and so on. Every specific subject area has its own terminology, although some crossover does occur from subject to subject, particularly when the concept is the same, but sometimes even when it is not.

For example, **adder** is an English term which is used to describe two different concepts. In Zoology it is a snake and in the area of Computer Science it is a device which adds up numbers. Another example is the Irish term ***seol***. In the area of Sailing, it is a large piece of material which is hung up so that a boat is moved forward by the wind – **sail** in English. In the area of Craftsmanship, it is a device for weaving – **loom** in English.
